GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, built on top of Git. It allows developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code in repositories. GitHub facilitates teamwork by enabling multiple contributors to work on the same project simultaneously, review code changes, and resolve conflicts. It also provides tools for issue tracking, project management, and continuous integration, making it an essential resource for coders to streamline development workflows and share their work with the community.
