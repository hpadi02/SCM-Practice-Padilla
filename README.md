## What is Software Configuration Management (SCM)?

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the process of systematically managing changes to software. It helps teams control revisions, track project history, and ensure that code updates are made in a structured and predictable way. SCM includes version control, build management, change control, and release management.

## How GitHub Helps with SCM

GitHub is a powerful version control platform that makes SCM easy and collaborative. It allows users to:

- Track changes to code using commits.
- Collaborate through branches and pull requests.
- Maintain code quality through merge reviews.
- Revert to previous versions if bugs or issues arise.
- Document and share projects with README files and issue tracking.

GitHub streamlines the SCM process and improves team coordination and code stability.
